## How to Use

### Clear Browser Data
1. Select which data types to clear (cookies, cache, localStorage, history)
2. Choose a time range from the dropdown
3. Click "Clear Data"

### Network Capture
1. Navigate to the tab you want to capture
2. Click "Start" to begin recording network activity
3. Perform the actions you want to capture
4. Click "Stop & Download" to save the HAR file
   - Note: HAR Capture is tab-specific. If you navigate away, you need to return to the same tab to stop the capture.

### Screen Capture
- **For Screenshots**:
  1. Navigate to the tab you want to capture
  2. Click "Take Screenshot"
  3. Save the PNG file when prompted

- **For Video Recording**:
  1. Navigate to the tab where you want to begin recording
  2. Click "Record Video"
  3. Select which screen/window/tab to share when prompted
  4. Navigate freely during recording
  5. Click "Stop Recording" when finished (recording automatically stops after 5 minutes)
  6. Save the WebM file when prompted

### Theme Options
- Click on one of the theme icons in the top-right corner:
  - ‚òÄÔ∏è Light Theme
  - üåô Dark Theme
  - ‚öôÔ∏è System Theme (matches your OS/browser settings)
- Your theme choice will be remembered across sessions
- The theme will also apply to the recording page when capturing videos

## Technical Considerations

- You can only have 1 HAR capture happening at a time
- HAR Capture is tab-specific (if you start it in tab A, and go to tab B, you need to go back to A to stop and save)
- Video recordings are limited to 5 minutes to maintain reasonable file sizes
- The extension requires specific Chrome permissions:
  - cookies, browsingData, storage, debugger, tabs, activeTab, downloads
- When using System Theme, the tool will automatically update if your OS switches between light and dark mode

## Installation

### Developer Mode (for testing)
1. Download or clone the extension files
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. The Browser Support Tool icon should appear in your toolbar


## Troubleshooting

- If HAR capture fails, try refreshing the page and starting again
- If video recording doesn't start, check if you denied screen sharing permissions
- Clear browser data options require at least one checkbox to be selected
- If the extension seems unresponsive, try reloading the extension from chrome://extensions/
- If dark mode doesn't apply correctly, try toggling between themes or restarting the browser
