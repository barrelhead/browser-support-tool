## Technical Considerations

- You can only have 1 Support Bundle capture happening at a time
- Support Bundle Capture is tab-specific (if you start it in tab A, and go to tab B, you need to go back to A to stop and save)
- Video recordings are limited to 5 minutes to maintain reasonable file sizes
- The extension requires specific Chrome permissions:
  - cookies, browsingData, storage, debugger, tabs, activeTab, downloads
- When using System Theme, the tool will automatically update if your OS switches between light and dark mode

## Installation

### Developer Mode (for testing)
1. Download or clone the extension files
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. The Browser Support Tool icon should appear in your toolbar

## Troubleshooting

- If Support Bundle capture fails, try refreshing the page and starting again
- If video recording doesn't start, check if you denied screen sharing permissions
- Clear browser data options require at least one checkbox to be selected
- If the extension seems unresponsive, try reloading the extension from chrome://extensions/
- If dark mode doesn't apply correctly, try toggling between themes or restarting the browser
